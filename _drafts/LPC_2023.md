This year's (2023) Linux Plumbers Conference was held in Richmond,VA where three of the ongoing
projects were accepted to give a 20 minute talk in the [Networking & BPF track](https://lpc.events/event/17/sessions/155/#20231113). 
In the order of when they were presented and link to the talks: 
 * [When BPF programs need to die](https://lpc.events/event/17/contributions/1610/) (Raj Sahu)  
 * [Overflowing the kernel stack with BPF](https://lpc.events/event/17/contributions/1595/) (Sai Roop Somaraju, Siddharth Chintamaneni)
 * [Advancing Kernel Control Flow Integrity with eBPF](https://lpc.events/event/17/contributions/1591/) (Jinghao Jia UIUC) 

## Talk Discussions
At the end of each talk, audience members posed interesting questions which in some cases highlighted
potential use-cases or even limitations. 

### BPF Termination 
For the first talk about BPF termination, one of the concerns posed by Daniel Borkmann was about 
the impact of the proposed BPF termination mechanism (which is to patch BPF programs with a 
lightweight version at runtime) on other CPUs due to the code section being shared. An immediate 
solution of having percpu BPF text might solve this problem however with an obvious penalty of high
memory overhead specially when there are hundreds of CPUs and 100s of BPF programs, something which is
not unrealistic for Big Techs using eBPF. Also, patching a program which is being executed currently
can be dangerous if not done correctly. 

Alexei Starovoitov had similar concerns and mentioned about how some termination use-cases would 
want to only affect a single execution on a given CPU while others would demand a global affect such 
as from sched\_ext.

## Takeaways from other interesting talks 
The talk "Evolving the BPF Type Format (BTF)" provided some insights about various issues faced when 
adopting BTF for tracing and debugging such a bloating of vmlinux due to addition of BTF data which 
is an issue for memory constrained embedded devices and proposed BTF to be a module which can be loaded
only when needed.
