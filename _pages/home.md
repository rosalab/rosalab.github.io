### Hello World!

We are investigating new memory-safe computing abstractions within the kernel, with a goal to support complex (but safe) kernel abstractions and potentially evolving Linux itself towards memory safety.

### About me

I'm currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, which I joined in August 2021. Prior to joining VT, I spent 10 years as a Research Staff Member at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY. I also taught operating systems as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Vassar College in 2020. I received my PhD from Cornell University under the guidance of Hakim Weatherspoon.
